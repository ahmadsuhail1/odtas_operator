This project is a prototype and is in development phase. 
ODTAS is a desktop and computer vision based system aimed at solving aerial surveillance problems.

It includes modules like object detection, object tracking (SOT and MOT), picking right capturing device, save and upload videos for detections.

This repository only includes the backend of the operator side. 

The front-end repository of operator and admin portal repository (web based) will be merged later.

The desktop application for operator is built using Next JS and Electron JS.

You will need Python >= 3.8, NVIDIA graphic card, CUDA and PyTorch > 1.7 to run this application.

Stay tuned for more updates. Thankyou.
